# Deployment Guide for Eden Parfum Website

## � Build Failure Fix - Missing Dependencies

If you're getting dependency errors during deployment, here are the solutions:

### Quick Fix Options:

#### **Option 1: Use Simple Netlify Config**
1. Rename current `netlify.toml` to `netlify.toml.backup`
2. Rename `netlify-simple.toml` to `netlify.toml`
3. Redeploy

#### **Option 2: Manual Netlify Settings**
In Netlify Dashboard, set:
- **Build command**: (leave empty)
- **Publish directory**: `frontend`
- **Base directory**: (leave empty)

#### **Option 3: Skip npm install entirely**
Add this to your netlify.toml:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "frontend"
  ignore = "exit 0"
```

## �🚀 Quick Fix for Current Issues

Your website wasn't loading because you were trying to deploy a full-stack app to static hosting platforms. Here's how to fix it:

## ✅ For Netlify Deployment

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Set **Publish directory** to: `frontend`
   - Set **Build command** to: (leave empty or `echo 'Static site'`)
   - The `netlify.toml` file will handle the rest

2. **If using manual upload:**
   - Zip only the `frontend` folder contents
   - Upload to Netlify

## ✅ For GitHub Pages Deployment

1. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to your repo → Settings → Pages
   - Set source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Push your changes to the main branch
   - The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will deploy automatically

2. **Alternative (Simple):**
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select branch: `main`
   - Select folder: `/frontend`

## 📁 What's Been Fixed

✅ **Added `netlify.toml`** - Tells Netlify to serve from frontend folder
✅ **Added `_redirects`** - Handles routing for single-page app behavior  
✅ **Added GitHub Actions workflow** - Automates GitHub Pages deployment
✅ **Updated package.json** - Added deployment scripts and instructions

## 🔍 Why It Wasn't Working Before

- You have both `frontend` and `backend` folders
- Static hosting (Netlify/GitHub Pages) can only serve the frontend
- Your deployment was trying to serve the entire project instead of just the frontend
- Missing configuration files for proper routing

## 🌐 Testing Locally

Before deploying, test that everything works:

```bash
# In the frontend directory
cd frontend
npx live-server --port=8080 --open=/index.html
```

## 📱 What Should Work Now

- ✅ Home page loads correctly
- ✅ Navigation between pages
- ✅ All images and styles load
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Contact forms and interactions

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check browser console** for any error messages
2. **Verify image paths** - make sure all photos exist in the photos folder
3. **Test locally first** before deploying
4. **Clear browser cache** after deployment

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Deploy using one of the methods above
3. Your website should now load correctly!
